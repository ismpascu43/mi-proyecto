Interactive Memory Game
It's an interactive game designed to test your memory 🧠 and mental agility ⚡. Players must find a certain number of pairs 🔍 before time ⏳ runs out. With different modes and difficulty levels, it's suitable for all ages 👨👩👧👦.

The game features:

Three difficulty modes (Easy 🌱, Medium 🔷, and Hard 🔥), which change the number of cards 🃏.

Two game modes:

Classic: Find identical pairs (e.g., 🐶 + 🐶).

Reverse: Find opposite pairs (e.g., ☀️ + 🌙, ❤️ + 💔).

To start, players must enter their name 📛. The top five 🏆 highest scores (achieved in the fewest attempts) are automatically saved in a ranking 📊. This ranking can be reset using the "Reset Ranking" button ♻️.

Additionally, the game offers a light/dark display mode 🌞🌙 for a personalized experience.
